      accepts a request and mediates among multiple language projects, such as
      LUIS Generally Available, Question Answering, Conversational Language
      Understanding, and then calls the best candidate service to handle the
      request. At last, it returns a response with the candidate service's
      response as a payload.

       In some cases, this API needs to forward requests and responses between the caller and an upstream service. The asynchronous APIs in this suite enable tasks like Conversation Summarization and Conversational PII detection.
